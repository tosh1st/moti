  <h1>HINDUISM</h1>
  <p>
    We, as humans, seek meaning and purpose that is bigger than our material existence. 
    Hinduism’s goal, like many other religion’s, is to provide true answers to the existential questions that we ask ourselves. 
    The primary doctrine of Hinduism is presented in the books of Veda. Veda is a Sanskrit word which means knowledge. 
    The word is etymologically related to English words like Video and Witness, as part of Indo-European language family. 
    Additional Hindu philosophy is presented in the books of Upanishads, which translates in Sanskrit to “sitting down near the teacher to study”. 
    The literature is further expanded is the books of Puranas. The name signifies that these works contain old knowledge that is still relevant today.

    Human life is spent seeking the Ultimate Truth, or “Athato Brahma Jijnasa” as stated in the first verse of the Hindi text of Mīmāṁsā. 
    This ultimate truth and purpose cannot be found in material pleasures. 
    The truth is to be found in Brahma which is the transcendental world that is beyond material nature. Brahma is nirakar, assim, nirgun. 
    Nirakar means devoid of any form; Assim means infinite or limitless; and Nirgun means devoid of any qualities. 
    Brahma extends from the largest to the smallest. 
    Brahma extends beyond the realms of inquiries done by great scientists like Einstein and Newton. 
    As scientific knowledge expands through advancements in relativity, quantum mechanics and ultimately, the theory of everything, it remains to be seen if they will arrive at the same answers as prescribed in the quest for Brahma.

    Hindu philosophy identifies four pursuits in life: Artha (Wealth), Kama (pleasure), Dharma (Morality), and Moksya (Spirituality). 
    Wealth and Pleasure do not satisfy humans, so we seen Moksya, or spiritual liberation through religion. 
    This quest separates us from other animals. As it is stated in Sanskrit:
    <br>
    <i>Aahar Nindra Bhaya Maithunan Cha</i>
    <br>
    <i>Samanyametat Pashubhir Naranaam</i>
  <br>
    Food, Sleep, Fear, and Mating are common between Animals and Humans
    <br>
    <i>Dharmo Hi Tesham Adhiko Vishesho</i>
    <br>
    <i>Dharmena Hina Pashubhih Samanah</i>
  <br>
    <i>Dharma</i> is the special differentiator that makes us humans, and without it we would be like animals.

    Hindu philosophy wasn’t derived from a single individual or a single idea. 
    Neither is it limited by geography or time. 
    Hinduism captures universal truths that allow practitioners to pursue and achieve self-realization. 
    It is a way of life or an “Art of Living”. 
    Hindu philosophy also allows us to orient the achievements made in physical sciences towards human welfare. 
    Hinduism protects us from ethical failures and defines natural laws that are universal and omnipresent. 
    As the physicist Firtjof Captra discusses in his book Tao of Physics, Eastern Mysticism and Modern Physics complement each other like the Yin and the Yang. 
    A tremendous amount of Human welfare to be derived from a balanced pursuit of both methods and lead to flourishment of kindness, gratitude, and other moral values. 
    Swami Vivekananda addressed the World’s Parliament of Religions in Chicago in 1893 as “Sisters and Brothers” to signify the oneness of humanity. 
    Vivekananda’s guru, Ramakrishma Paramhansa believed that all religions represented the same path to self-realization for the betterment of all humans. 
    Many techniques like Transcendental Meditation as prescribed by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, or organizations like ISKCON founded by Swami Prabhupada practice the pursuit the Ultimate Truth and spiritual advancement across the world. 
    They derive their essence from Vedic Sanata Dharma. 
    Dharma are natural laws derived from Vedas that are Sanata, meaning they are universal, general and timeless. 
    Similar to how the laws of gravitation and electro magnetism are universal to all physical beings from atoms to mountains and galaxies, the laws of Karma and morality described in Vedas are universal to all humans regardless of their nation, race or religion.
